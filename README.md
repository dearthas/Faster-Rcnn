In order to run the code, you need to install the library CNTK and to install the examples with the command "python -m cntk.sample_installer".
Then you have to convert the whole MNIST dataset thanks to my python program "processing.py" and follow the end of the tutorial :
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cognitive-toolkit/object-detection-using-faster-r-cnn#run-faster-r-cnn-on-your-own-data

The "old" folder contain the original pictures from the MNIST Dataset.
The "new" folder contain the new pictures after processing.
